# MMIO Tool for Wii-Linux

Originally created in 2024 internally for debugging by Techflash, this program allows one to poke various MMIO addresses on their GameCube or Wii, via /dev/mem, on [Wii-Linux](https://wii-linux.org).  
It was originally never intended for public release, though it has now been used so heavily that it's being released on GitHub for all to use.
